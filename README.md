## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN/ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.
Now when we think of a neural network we think about matrix multiplications but that is not the case with ConvNet.
It uses a special technique called Convolution.
Now in mathematics convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.


## :star: Dataset Description
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is the “Hello World!” of deep learning datasets and contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits under 10 categories (0 to 9).
